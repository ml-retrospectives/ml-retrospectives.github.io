# Code of Conduct:
**To view our full code of conduct, please refer [here](_pages/05_coc.md).**

ML Retrospectives and the Retrospectives workshop prioritize the maintenance of an inclusive environment that allows for a diversity of researchers to honestly reflect on developments in the field and opportunities for growth. 
Because critically reflecting on previous work is a sensitive subject, we outline here a set of principles and processes to support honest self-reflection within a healthy community of machine learning researchers.

All participants, including attendees, authors, members of the organizing committee, members of the program committee, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers, are required to agree with the following code of conduct. 
Organisers will enforce this code throughout the workshop and the review and publication process of Retrospectives.

# The Quick Version

Retrospectives is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. 
This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family status, technological or professional choices, academic discipline, religion, mental ability, and physical ability. 
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces in which Retrospectives are shared, both online and off. 
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.
